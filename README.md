# Spark-API-Development
This is a template API via PySpark! 

Greetings all! 

This is technically a RESTful API, but using PySpark module instead of 
the restful module! In this case, this is a template using PySpark
for website development! 

Here are the packages needed to perform a successful Spark API:

    pip install pyspark

PS: Launch the program using either Visual Studio Code or Pycharm! 

Happy Coding!
